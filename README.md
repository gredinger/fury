Fury is a very opinionated configuration management tool, operating in
a similar space to Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Saltstack and the like. It's
not at all production-ready, you should never use it.

I wrote it because I have strange [opinions](README.opinions.md) about
what my ideal config management system would be, and why I think all
existing systems are getting it fundamentally wrong. It's very
unlikely that I'm correct, but exploring the depths of my wrongness is
entertaining, and might result in something that _I_ at least like
using.

This is not an official Google project, if you hadn't guessed by now.
